===== Calculator =====

This application demonstrates some of qooxdoo's powerful layout and theming 
features.


=== Running the application ===

To run the application just open "build/index.html" in any supported browser.


=== Making changes ===

If you want to change code or run the debug (source) version you need a copy of
the qooxdoo 0.8.1 SDK:

1. Download the 0.8.1 SDK from http://qooxdoo.org/download
2. Unzip the SDK
3. Open the file "config.json" in the calculator and update the macro
   QOOXDOO_PATH. It must contain the relative path to the top level SDK
   directory

Now you can run "generate.py source" to generate the debug version and run it
from "source/index.html".


=== API documantation ===

The caluclator comes with pre generated API documentation for the calculator
classes and the qooxdoo SDK. To launch the API viewer open "api/index.html" in
a browser.
